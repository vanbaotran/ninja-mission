Welcome to our website Ninja Mission! 


Looking for a job is never something we are so excited about. It could be fun at first, after several rejection emails (which is totally normal) we don’t feel as excited anymore. We look for a job because we are not quite happy with our current position, or we are just freshly graduated. If you already have a job and are actively looking for an environment change, you want to do it in the morning on the way to work, but you need to actually sit in front of a computer to do it. So you wait until you get home to do so but you get caught up with a show on Netflix. Then you are never going to do it. 



=> Our website is to make applying for a job a fun experience with a job search app that feels more like a dating app instead of the traditional serious looking job boards out there. So instead of doing the usual boring job application where you have to submit your CV and then wait for a generic email telling you that they received your application and will get back to you. You are instead given the ability to swipe if you think it’s a match or not if you do not think so. Interaction with the hiring manager would feel so much more informal and casual. But of course there should be a way to limit interactions so it does not feel like spam and get overwhelming.
In this app, we used React, NodeJS, Mongoose, Express, JS, HTML5 and CSS3. 
Here is a mindmap to explain our idea of this website:
